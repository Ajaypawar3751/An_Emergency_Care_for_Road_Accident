# An_Emergency_Care_for_Road_Accident
The Emergency Care for Road Accidents project aims to help citizens by using their own smartphones’ in-built sensors, to report road accidents if happened while moving on the road. The ECRA user system will identify the location with the support of in-built sensors in the Smartphone. It will alert the nearest police station with accident coordinates and shows hospitals nearby your location for getting medical assistance. After receiving an alert from ECRA, police will be able to arrive at the scene more quickly and do their jobs more effectively.  This web application works with Mobile Data or Wi-Fi, and does not even require a special app—just activate Location / GPS Settings on your phone and go!
